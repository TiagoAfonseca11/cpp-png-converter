# Projects
College Programming Project
Languages: C/C++, using headers files

The program receives an x number of images of type .png and translate them into .svg images.
SVG images have several advantages for designers: donâ€™t lose quality when scaled up or down; Edited manually in any text editor; Indexed by search engines.

Project difficulty (0-10): 6.5, my first project :)
